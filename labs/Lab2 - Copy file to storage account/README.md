# Lab 2 - Upload file to storage account

In this lab we are retriving a text file from GitHub and saving it locally on our PC so we can upload to your Azure Data Lake storage account.

- Step 1 The file that we are transforming in this tutorial is MoviesDB.csv. To retrieve the file from GitHub, copy the contents to a text editor of your choice to save locally as a .csv file. 
  The file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djpmsft/adf-ready-demo/master/moviesDB.csv).
