## Learning how to self-learn (Thank you Buck Woody)

Many of these topics are quite deep, and take time to fully absorb. There are several phases of learning:

 - Awareness (You learn a technology exists and what it is used for)
 - Understanding (You learn the components, processes and steps of a technology)
 - Practice (You can perform the steps with the technology by following a process to complete a task)
 - Mastery (You are able to explain the technology to others)

These courses are designed for you to repeat many times to move through these phases. You may want to complete a "Learning how to Learn" course. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html" target="_blank">You can find more information on that here</a>.
